# Pixel Art Marker
An project from my Udacity course

In this project, I make a pixel art maker using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The user can:

- Input initial grid size in DESIGN CANVAS window
- Color pixels when you click the mouse
- You can change pen color using color picker in PICK A COLOR panel
